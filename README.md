# Check Domain
Live check domain for existence. Uses the core https://nodejs.org domain interface to check domain names on the web.

Uses a simple logic.

`existing domains have ip addresses associated with them`

Using such information can give you information about the domain name, including their name servers, web hosts, when the domain name was purchased, who sold out the domain
and a bunch of such related infomation.

This project is not complete yet, but gives required infomation. More tweaks can be added to make it more robust.
